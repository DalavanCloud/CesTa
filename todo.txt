Architecture
	- collect important data during first parsing and share it accross transformations (symbol table, ...)
	- allow calling other transformations programatically via simple API
	
Grammars
	- optimize grammars and throw away backtracking

Task
	- we could add new type "paramGroup", that would contain other params, have id and could be referenced between transformations
